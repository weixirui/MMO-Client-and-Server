 *         <p>
 *         This is the ClosedIDSystem. It houses a finite number of IDTags,
 *         which can be distributed for use. The purpose behind this is to
 *         ensure completely that no two entities ever share the same unique ID,
 *         therefore making differentiation much easier. No other class can
 *         create more IDTags, ensuring the pool of legitimate tags isn't
 *         polluted with false tags.
 *         </p>
 *         <p>
 *         There is only one method this static utility provides, and that is
 *         getTag. Once a tag is finished being used, ie the entity it's
 *         attached to is removed, the IDTag MUST be returned into the system by
 *         calling returnTag on the IDTag itself. The ONLY way to mess up this
 *         system is if the tags aren't returned, so make sure they are. I even
 *         wrote a custom data type to house the tags so that removal doesn't
 *         take O(n) time, where n is the number of items in queue.
 *         </p>
