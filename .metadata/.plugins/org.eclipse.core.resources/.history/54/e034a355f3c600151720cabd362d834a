 *
 *         Main is the main class and entry point of the MMOServer. I also
 *         handles the "tick" mechanics.
 *
 *         <p>
 *         A tick in this server framework is simply a notification to all the
 *         threads running TickReliant objects telling them to wake up from
 *         their wait call. All tick reliants invoke <code>wait()</code> on the
 *         TICK_LOCK object, which they retrieve from this class. When a "tick"
 *         is sent out, <code>notifyAll()</code> is called on TICK_LOCK, which
 *         in turn allows threads to exit wait and begin execution of their tick
 *         procedures. Once a tick begins, the main thread (the one used during
 *         entry into this class, which also handles ticking) waits until all
 *         TickReliant objects have finished their tick procedures. The main
 *         thread then waits out any remaining time, then notifies all the
 *         threads waiting on TICK_LOCK to start a new tick cycle, infinitely
 *         repeating.
 *         </p>
 * 
 *         <p>
 *         Another neat feature is that whenever a TickReliant thread fails
 *         because of an uncaught exception, the whole server pauses (after the
 *         current tick) so that debugging may commence. From there, the thread
 *         can actually be restarted from a button in the GUI.
 *         </p>
